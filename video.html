    <!--Intro to the project-->
    <section class="video">
        <h2>Video</h2>
        <p>We had to come up with a "How to" concept in this project, and film and edit a video based on this
            concept. Me and my group came up with "How To Hygge" since it's a very foreign concept for alot of people
            who
            aren't danish. It's a very individual term that means different things to different people. Therefore we
            decided to walk around Copenhagen and interview peoples different ideas of what "hygge" was to them. We went
            to a cafe, took a walk around the lakes, went to a bar, and finaly went to Tivoli to enjoy the "hygge".
            Everything is edited in Premier Pro and After Effects.</p>
